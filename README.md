This project utilizes a day trading technique I found in a magazine called Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities.  The basic concept of the technique is to monitor two inversely correlated ETFs and trade one or the other depending on the day.  In the article, the trader would monitor with stop losses and have to track one of the ETFs up or down.  I wanted to automate this so you can just run the python file and forget about it.  If you want to try this out yourself, you will need to have a TD Ameritrade account as well as a TD Developer app created.  If you have a TD Ameritrade account but no developer app, go to this link https://developer.tdameritrade.com/ , and create one.  You will need a client id to send requests to the TD Ameritrade API, this client id can be entered in the loader.py file.  Once that is setup, create a virtual environment and run the command pip install to ensure all python libraries are installed.  Then, navigate into the tvix_svxy_trader folder and run the command python3 check_hours.py.  The project is setup to scan the prices every 5 minutes and show the user what the application is buying or selling at the moment.  All of the trades may be monitored in a sqlite3 database as well.  Please reach out if you have any questions about my project!
